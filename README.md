## Web Performance

Web Starter Kit strives to give you a high performance starting point out of the box. Our median Web Page Test [scores](http://www.webpagetest.org/result/151201_VW_XYC/) for the default template have a [Speed Index](https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/metrics/speed-index) of ~1100 (1000 is ideal) and a repeat-visit Speed Index of ~550 thanks to Service Worker precaching.

## Browser Support

At present, we officially aim to support the last two versions of the following browsers:

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Safari
* Opera
* Internet Explorer 9+

This is not to say that Web Starter Kit cannot be used in browsers older than those reflected, but merely that our focus will be on ensuring our layouts work great in the above.
